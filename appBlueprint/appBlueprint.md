The goal of this application is to learn about AI application. 

The current project is aiming to use AI to detect annomaly in Windows OS system logs. 

User will input system logs and the APP will generate results. 

I will use Python and Flask library for a simple local host webapp. Then do port forwarding for deploying the application for user to use.
